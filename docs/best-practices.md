# Best practices

Canonical checklist for writing, running, and hosting mklang machines.
**How to author a correct file:** [Authoring](authoring.md).  
**How to tune reliability and cost:** [Patterns](patterns.md).  
**What the language guarantees:** [SPEC](../SPEC.md) (cookbook §10, threat model §11).

This page answers: *what should I always do, never do, and where does each rule live?*

---

## 1. Layer discipline (do not mix layers)

| Layer | Owns | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language (`.mk`)** | Control flow, prose contracts, portable structure | states, gates, tiers, `tool:` *names*, `parse: list` |
| **Host runtime** | Bindings, budgets, clocks, truncation *policy*, LLM adapters | `tools={…}`, hooks, `on_truncate`, `context.today` fill, search backend |
| **Surface** | UX, consent, compact observations | CLI flags, MCP tools, console brain, workspace FS for `.mk` only |

**Rules**

- Side effects live only in **`tool:` states** (host callables). Never in `execution` or generative prompts.
- The `.mk` **never** names a provider or model — only `tier:` (ADR 0003).
- Host tools are **opaque names** + `(dict) → str`. Do not promote search/bash/FS into language syntax.
- Generic **bash / filesystem** stay **out of core** (console: workspace `.mk` only; production I/O = plugins or external host).

---

## 2. Authoring checklist (every machine)

Before shipping a `.mk`:

- [ ] Schema header + `mklang: "0.3"` when using 0.3 faces (`parse: list`, …).
- [ ] Every non-terminal state ends with **`when: otherwise`** (last).
- [ ] At least one path reaches **`END`**; `budget` ≥ shortest path (+ headroom).
- [ ] Every `{{path}}` root is `context:`, a state `output:`, HITL `human.*`, or fan-out `item`/`index`.
- [ ] Exact policy (amounts, allowlists, formats) uses **`hook:`**, not prose alone.
- [ ] Real I/O uses **`tool:`** + top-level `tools:` declarations for documentation.
- [ ] Time-sensitive machines declare **`today: ""`** in `context:` and use `Today is {{today}}` in prompts.
- [ ] Irreversible actions sit behind **`escalate`** (and HITL in production).
- [ ] `mklang check` clean; `mklang lint` clean (use `--strict` in CI).
- [ ] Scenario tests cover happy path **and** escape hatches (`mklang test`).

---

## 3. Gates and reliability

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Put **hooks above** prose gates; keep `when` as the human-readable trace label | Ask the LLM to check `amount <= 100` |
| Cap `repair` at 1–2, then `escalate` or `fail` | Open-ended repair-only states |
| Give escalate a **safe sink** state (human / fallback) | Fail closed only when that is truly required |
| Read **trace** (gate, `judge_fallback`, nested `call`) when debugging | Trust only the final `result` string |
| Use `reason: true` when the *why* must be auditable | Dump chain-of-thought into `output` / context |

Gate judging **follows the state tier** by default. Use config `judge:` only when all gates are deliberately cheap classifications (SPEC §2.1).

Optional: `mklang lint --llm` to probe overlapping prose `when` conditions (advisory; not CI-blocking).

---

## 4. Tools (host contracts)

### 4.1 Principles

1. Declare expected tools under top-level **`tools:`** (`name` + `description`).
2. Invoke only via **`tool:`** states; map inputs with `input:` (whole-template `{{path}}` stays raw in 0.3).
3. Treat **observations as untrusted** blackboard data (SPEC §11) — especially web snippets.
4. Prefer **entry points** (`mklang.tools` / `mklang.hooks`) for production bindings over editing core.

### 4.2 Observation envelope (ADR 0020)

I/O and side-effect tools return **JSON** with stable fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `tool` | Tool name |
| `stub` | `true` if no real external system was used |
| `error` | Failure / unbound message, or `null` |
| *(payload)* | Tool-specific: `results`, `facts`, `sent`, … |

Tiers: **stub** (default) → **fake** (env/`configure_*`) → **live** (key or entry-point).  
`calc` is pure offline arithmetic and does **not** use this envelope.

### 4.3 Recommended host tool contracts (reference interpreter)

These names are **conventions**, not language keywords. Other hosts may rebind or omit them.

#### `search` (ADR 0016 / 0020)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Input** | `query` (required), `max_results?` (1–10), `days?`, `topic?` (`news` \| `general`) |
| **Output** | JSON: `{tool, stub, error, query, results:[{title,url,snippet,published_date?}]}` |
| **Default** | Stub unbound (`error` explains how to enable) |
| **Enable** | `TAVILY_API_KEY` (auto) or `MKLANG_SEARCH_BACKEND=fake\|tavily\|stub` |

**Practice:** plan → `tool: search` → check sufficiency → finalize grounded **only** in notes. Never “search the web” only in prose.

#### `search_kb` (ADR 0020)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Input** | `query` (or `q`) |
| **Output** | JSON: `{tool, stub, error, query, facts: [str, …], note?}` |
| **Default** | Demo policy facts, always `stub: true` |
| **Fake** | `MKLANG_KB_BACKEND=fake` or `mklang.kb.configure_kb` |

Replace with real RAG via entry points in production.

#### `send_reply` (ADR 0020)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Input** | `body` (or `draft`), `to?` |
| **Output** | JSON: `{tool, stub, sent, recorded, delivery, to, chars, preview, error, note?}` |
| **Default stub** | `sent: false`, `delivery: "stub"` — **does not** claim real mail left the host |
| **Fake** | `MKLANG_MAIL_BACKEND=fake` → in-memory outbox, `delivery: "fake"`, `sent: true`, still `stub: true` |

Never ask the model to “confirm the message was sent.” Gates should treat `sent: false` as no delivery.

#### `calc`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Input** | `expr` (or `query`): arithmetic expression |
| **Output** | Decimal string, or `error: …` (not the I/O envelope) |

Safe subset only (no `eval` of Python). Use for ReAct demos and numeric observations.

### 4.3 What not to bake into the language

| Temptation | Keep as |
| --- | --- |
| Web search, HTTP, email, payments | Host `tool:` |
| Shell / arbitrary FS / git | Host plugin (sandboxed), never core |
| Console `write_machine` / `run_machine` | Console surface only |
| “Current date” as `$now` keyword | Declared `context.today` + host fill |

---

## 5. Web, time, and knowledge cutoff

Live or news-like questions fail in predictable ways if the machine relies on model training data.

| Practice | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Use `tool: search`** | `research_web.mk`, `research_compress.mk`, `news_search.mk` |
| **Declare `today: ""`** | Host fills ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` when still empty after inputs (CLI / MCP / console) |
| **Prompt with calendar** | `Today is {{today}}`; include year in queries when time-sensitive |
| **Recency inputs** | Prefer `days` + `topic: news` for news machines |
| **Ground finalize** | Cite titles/URLs/`published_date` from notes only |
| **Forbid fill-in** | Explicitly ban inventing facts or answering from pre-training when notes are empty/thin |
| **Honest failures** | If stub says search unbound, tell the operator how to enable it — do not fabricate hits |

**Language note:** there is no primitive that “disables knowledge cutoff.” Discipline is host clock + tools + prose + gates.

---

## 6. Output cutoff and context budgets (anti-cutoff)

| Layer | What happens | Practice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Produce length stop** | Trace/events get `truncated: true` (ADR 0018) | Prefer adequate `max_tokens` in runtime `params`; use `--on-truncate halt` for strict runs |
| **Default policy** | `report` continues with partial text | Do not treat partial finalize as complete without checking trace |
| **`parse: list` + truncate** | Halts `parse-list-truncated` | Keep planner outputs short and well-structured |
| **Produce `{{…}}` budget** | Long values end with `…[truncated]` (ADR 0017) | Compress notes before the next loop (`research_compress.mk`) |
| **Judge CONTEXT** | Head+tail + `…[context_truncated]…` | Put critical facts in **state output**, not only deep context |
| **Console observation** | Compact JSON: `truncated`, `result_truncated`, `…[truncated]` on clipped result | Brain/user must report cuts — never invent the missing tail |

Continue-stitching after length stop is **deferred** (not default).

---

## 7. Memory and composition

| Situation | Practice |
| --- | --- |
| Growing `accumulate` lists | Explicit **compress** generative state; do not rely on silent host summary |
| Plan → map | Planner uses `parse: list`; executor `over: "{{steps}}"` |
| Pass lists into `call`/`tool` | Whole-template `input: { x: "{{list}}" }` (0.3 raw resolution) |
| Reuse architecture | Prefer **`std_*`** (`call: std_refine`, …) over copy-paste |
| Host-dependent patterns | ReAct / router / hooks stay authored examples, not pure stdlib |

---

## 8. Budgets and cost

- **Step `budget`:** worst-case path × loops + fan-out width; leave repair headroom.
- **Fan-out:** charges `max(1, len(branches))` at runtime; static check counts fan-out as 1.
- **Token cost:** `--max-tokens` / `cost_budget` shared with `call` children.
- **Tiers:** default `balanced`; cascade `fast` → escalate → `reasoning` for mostly-easy work.
- **Sample diversity:** temperature and/or `{{index}}` in the prompt; do not assume all reasoners sample.

---

## 9. Testing and CI

| Layer | Command | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema + semantics | `mklang check` | Blocking shape/graph |
| Static smells | `mklang lint` (`--strict` in CI) | Typos, dead gates, unread outputs |
| Prose gate overlap | `mklang lint --llm` | Advisory only |
| Path pinning | `mklang test … --script …` | No API keys; escape hatches |
| Language contract | `pytest` + `conformance/` | Interpreter semantics |
| Live smoke | `MKLANG_LIVE=1 pytest tests/test_live.py` | Opt-in providers |

Keep `machine.test.yaml` beside the machine. Cover escalate, repair exhaustion, empty tool results, and search-unbound paths for web machines.

---

## 10. Security (SPEC §11) — operational minimum

- Treat customer text and search snippets as **injection-capable**.
- Prefer **hooks + HITL** before irreversible tools.
- Checkpoints hold the **full blackboard** in plaintext (mode `0600` is a floor, not encryption).
- Do not put secrets in `.mk` or context; keys stay in host env / `.env`.
- Console: tool **consent** once per session; workspace confinement for authored `.mk` files.

---

## 11. Surfaces quick reference

| Surface | Best practice |
| --- | --- |
| **CLI** | `check` → `lint` → `test` → `run`; `--on-truncate halt` for strict research; `--hitl` + checkpoint for human gates |
| **MCP** | Commission by name/path/source; stream `mklang.event`; durable `checkpoint_path` for multi-process HITL |
| **Console** | Prefer RUN of workspace/search machines for live facts; honor truncation fields in observations; enable Tavily for web |

---

## 12. Anti-patterns (quick list)

1. `execution: use the search tool` on a generative state.
2. Asking the model to confirm a side effect it cannot perform.
3. Prose-only money/policy thresholds.
4. Answering “what happened this week?” without `tool: search` and `today`.
5. Silent acceptance of truncated produce / clipped console result as complete.
6. Unbounded `accumulate` without compress.
7. `budget` sized for the happy path only.
8. Naming `claude-…` / `gpt-…` inside the `.mk`.
9. Putting PII into checkpoints without a retention policy.
10. Expecting stdlib pure machines to perform host I/O.
11. Treating a stub `send_reply` as real delivery (`sent` must be true **and** `stub` false for live).

---

## 13. Language vs host: what may become language later

Candidates for a future **0.4** (need ADR + conformance) — **not** current practice requirements:

| Candidate | Why it might become language |
| --- | --- |
| `parse: json` / object | Structured composition beyond lists |
| Machine/state `on_truncate` policy | Portable anti-cutoff in the document |
| Context zones / pin (ADR 0017 L2) | Trusted vs untrusted blackboard |
| Per-gate `hitl:` | Finer HITL than run-level |
| Budget split (steps vs fan-out width) | Clearer volume caps |

Until then: use **host policy + patterns + this checklist**. Do **not** invent ad-hoc syntax outside the schema.
