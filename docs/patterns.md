# Recommended configurations & flows

Operating guidance for building good machines. The **cookbook** ([`SPEC.md §10`](../SPEC.md))
maps _architectures_ to constructs; this page is about configuring them _well_.

**Canonical checklist** (do / don't / layers / tool contracts / anti-patterns):
[Best practices](best-practices.md). **Correct-file recipe:** [Authoring](authoring.md).

## Tiers — route by cost, escalate for quality

| Use `fast` for               | Use `balanced` for     | Use `reasoning` for                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| classify, route, extract     | most generative states | validation, synthesis, critical gates |
| high-volume fan-out branches | drafting               | final answers, policy judgements      |

- **Default `default_tier: balanced`.** Override per state; don't reach for
  `reasoning` reflexively — it's the expensive tier.
- **Gate judging follows the state's tier by default** (SPEC §2.1): a `reasoning`
  state's high-stakes gates (refund thresholds, legal matters, human escalation) are
  judged by the reasoning model, not silently downgraded. The `judge:` config key is
  an **opt-in global override** that forces one model for *all* gate judging — a
  cost/latency optimization that also downgrades your most critical gates, so reach
  for it only when your gates really are uniform, cheap classifications.
- **Speculative cascade** beats a flat `reasoning` machine on cost: draft at `fast`,
  and let an `escalate` gate promote only the low-confidence cases to a `reasoning`
  state. Same answers, a fraction of the tokens.

## Reliability — gates are the safety net

- **Use code-hook gates for exact checks** (`hook: name` → host `(ctx, output) -> bool`).
  Amounts, equality, allowlists: do **not** ask the LLM. Put hooks **above** prose
  gates; keep `when` as the trace label. See `examples/hook_gates.mk` and ADR 0006.
  Custom tools/hooks: package entry points `mklang.tools` / `mklang.hooks` (see
  CONTRIBUTING).
- **Never put real I/O in generative states.** Searching, sending mail, charging a
  card: use `tool:` states (host callables). Do not write `execution: use tool X`
  on a generative state — the model cannot call tools there and will invent
  observations. Do not ask the model to "confirm the message was sent."
- **Honest stub observations (ADR 0020).** Reference I/O tools return JSON with
  `tool`, `stub`, `error`. Default `send_reply` has `sent: false`; default
  `search` is unbound until Tavily/fake is enabled. Read `stub`/`error` before
  treating an observation as live data ([Best practices §4](best-practices.md)).
- **Web search is a host tool, not a model skill.** Builtin `search` is a
  structured stub until a backend is bound. **`TAVILY_API_KEY` alone auto-enables
  Tavily**; or set `MKLANG_SEARCH_BACKEND=fake|tavily|stub`. Never put "search
  the web" only in generative `prompt`/`execution` — the model will invent hits.
  Use `tool: search` (see `examples/research_web.mk`, `machines/news_search.mk`).
  Optional tool inputs: `days`, `topic` (`news`|`general`); results may include
  `published_date`. Snippets are **untrusted** (SPEC §11).
- **`execution` for sticky policy.** The reference interpreter puts `structure` +
  `execution` on the **system** channel and `prompt` on **user**. Prefer
  durable guardrails in `execution` (no inventing search, honesty on truncation)
  and keep `{{…}}` data in `prompt` ([Best practices §3](best-practices.md)).
- **Host clock convention (`today` / `now`).** Declare empty keys in `context:`;
  CLI / MCP / console fill them only when declared — they never invent
  undeclared keys. This is host convention + authoring discipline, not a
  language primitive.

  | Key | Fill | Use for |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `today: ""` | ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD` | News/recency, knowledge-cutoff framing |
  | `now: ""` | Local ISO datetime with offset | Wall-clock (“what time is it?”) |

  Prompts should say `Today is {{today}}` / `Current local time is {{now}}`,
  prefer recent sources, and **forbid filling gaps with pre-training knowledge**
  older than that date.
- **Watch for output cutoff.** When a produce hits max_tokens, the runtime sets
  `truncated: true` on the trace step and on live `state-done` events (ADR 0018).
  Default policy is `report` (annotate and continue); use `--on-truncate halt`
  or `run(..., on_truncate="halt")` (also on MCP/console) for strict runs.
  Prefer raising tier `max_tokens` params over relying on auto-continue
  (continue stitching is deferred, not the default). Console `run_machine`
  observations **propagate** produce truncation and mark clipped results with
  `…[truncated]` + `result_truncated` — never treat a cut observation as complete.
- **Bound growing blackboards (working memory vs archive).** Long `accumulate`
  / research loops explode prompts. Prefer an explicit **compress** generative
  state that rewrites a key shorter before the next loop — see
  `examples/research_compress.mk`. The host does **not** summarize for you: it
  only caps judge CONTEXT (head+tail marker), per-value produce interpolation
  (high default, `…[truncated]`), and console brain history (last N turns /
  chars). Transcript and full `Session.history` stay the audit archive; only
  the prompt view is windowed (ADR 0017).
- **Treat `{{context}}` as untrusted** when it may contain customer or web text.
  Prose gates and prompts interpolate raw values; injection can steer transitions
  (SPEC §11). Prefer hooks + HITL before irreversible tools.
- **End every non-terminal state with an `otherwise` gate.** Without it, a run can
  `halt` with `no-gate-matched` — and if the judge returns garbage, the runtime
  **hard-halts** with `judge-unparseable` unless `otherwise` is eligible (soft
  fallback is recorded as `judge_fallback` in the trace). `mklang check` warns when
  the catch-all is missing.
- **Guarantee a reachable `END`.** `mklang check` errors if none exists.
- **Fix `unresolved-interpolation` lint before shipping.** `mklang lint` flags any
  `{{path}}` whose first segment no `context:` key, state `output:`, or (inside a
  fan-out) `item`/`index` provides — a typo (`{{kb_answr}}`) otherwise renders to an
  empty string and silently degrades the prompt. Under `--strict` it fails the run.
  If a host injects extra context keys at run time, declare them in `context:` with
  placeholder values so the reference to them resolves and the lint stays quiet.
  (When the root is an **inline `context:` map** — `ticket: {body: …}` — the second
  segment is checked too, so `{{ticket.bod}}` is caught. Deeper tails, and roots
  whose shape isn't statically known (state outputs, runtime `human`/`item`/`index`),
  are not verified against prose `structure`.)
- **Cap `repair`.** A `repair: N` with a modest `N` (1–2) plus a following
  `escalate`/`fail` gate prevents an endless self-correction loop.
- **Give escalation a safe sink.** Route hard cases to a terminal `human_review`
  state rather than failing — it's a graceful degrade, not a crash. With
  `--checkpoint --hitl` the run actually **pauses** on a fired escalate and
  `mklang resume --set human.reply="…"` feeds the decision to the handler
  (ADR 0008).
- **Size `budget` to the worst case.** Roughly: longest path × loop iterations, plus
  the width of any fan-out (a `sample: N` costs N steps). Leave headroom; hitting the
  budget is a `halt`.
- **Let `mklang check`/`lint` catch impossible budgets.** If `budget` is below the
  shortest path (in states) from `entry` to a gate `to: END`, validation reports
  error `budget-infeasible` — a guaranteed `budget-exhausted` before the first
  provider call. `budget < shortest + 2` is a warning (no headroom for a single
  repair). Fan-out states count as **1** in this static check (branch width is
  data-dependent), so a machine can still exhaust budget on a wide map even after
  the check passes (SPEC §7).
- **Map-reduce: size `budget` against data cardinality.** A fan-out charges
  `max(1, len(branches))` steps (SPEC §7), so `budget` is also a volume cap — an
  `over` on 30 items with `budget: 25` halts `budget-exhausted` before the reducer.
  Set `budget ≥ expected branches + machine overhead`, or bound the list before the
  fan-out. If the item count is unknown at authoring time, size for the worst case.
- **Use `--max-tokens` (cost budget) on long `call` trees.** The remaining budget is
  shared with sub-machines so a runaway child cannot burn tokens unbounded.
- **Fan-out concurrency** is a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `max_workers=5` today —
  fine for modest `sample`/`over` widths; very wide maps should stay small or wait
  for the async roadmap item.

## Testing — pin the gates before you spend a token

- **Write scenario tests for every gate you would be embarrassed to see misfire.**
  `mklang test machine.mk --script machine.test.yaml` runs the machine against a
  **scripted LLM** (produce texts + judge picks) and scripted tools/hooks — no
  provider, no API key, fully deterministic. Each scenario is a named case in the
  conformance format (`llm`/`tools`/`hooks`/`run` + `expect`), and the runner
  shares its matcher with the [conformance suite](../conformance/README.md), so a
  green scenario means the *interpreter* would route your machine exactly that way.
- **Cover both the happy path and the escape hatches.** The value is in the
  branches you hope never fire: the escalate-to-human path, the repair loop giving
  up, the empty-tool-result fallback. Script the judge pick that steers into each
  and assert the `trace` skeleton (`state` → `to`, `policy`) lands where you think.
  See [`examples/triage.test.yaml`](../examples/triage.test.yaml) (happy path +
  KB-empty escalation).
- **Keep scenarios next to the machine** (`triage.mk` → `triage.test.yaml`) and
  run them in CI — a `.mk` edit that reroutes a gate fails the scenario, not a
  customer.

## Reasoning & observability

- **Use `reason: true` on states whose _why_ matters** (diagnosis, judgement,
  synthesis). The chain-of-thought lands in the trace, not the context — you get
  auditability without polluting downstream prompts. On reasoner models it maps to
  native thinking for free.
- **Read the trace, not just the result.** Every transition records the gate that
  fired and (for fan-out/`call`) the nested detail. When a run goes wrong, the trace
  says exactly where and why.

## Composite flows (which pattern when)

| Situation                                        | Reach for                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| One high-stakes answer, want robustness          | **Self-consistency** (`sample` → vote)               |
| Many similar items (docs, tickets, rows)         | **Map-Reduce** (`over` → reducer)                    |
| Quality-critical prose                           | **Reflexion** (`repair` loop, or a critic)           |
| Distinct request types → distinct handling       | **Router-of-experts** (classify → `call`)            |
| Mostly-easy workload, occasional hard case       | **Speculative cascade** (fast → escalate)            |
| Open-ended tool-using task                       | **ReAct** (think → `tool` state → `accumulate` loop) |
| Explore several partial solutions, keep the best | **Tree-of-Thought** (`sample` → select → loop)       |

## Provider notes

- The `.mk` never names a model — only tiers. Pick models in
  [`config/runtime.example.yaml`](../config/runtime.example.yaml) (default
  `active: deepseek`); keys come from `.env` (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, …). Switching
  provider is a one-line `active:` change or `mklang run --provider …`.
- **Diversity for `sample`** comes from temperature; keep the sampling state on a
  model that honors it (most chat models do — some reasoner models ignore it). Each
  sample branch also sees its own `{{index}}` (0-based), so you can drive diversity
  explicitly — "you are branch {{index}}, take a different approach" (Tree-of-Thought,
  debate), not temperature alone.
- **`reason: true`** yields a captured chain only on models that expose thinking
  (Anthropic adaptive, DeepSeek `deepseek-reasoner`, o-series). On plain models the
  model still reasons internally; the trace just won't hold the scratchpad.
- **Per-tier `params` are applied** to each generation: `effort`/`thinking` on
  Anthropic, `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI/xAI, etc. They're best-effort — a param a
  provider doesn't support is dropped and the call retried, so mixing providers never
  breaks. Put them under `providers.<name>.params.<tier>` in the runtime config.
  Prefer setting a healthy `max_tokens` on balanced/reasoning tiers so produce is
  less likely to hit a length stop (ADR 0018); truncation is still traced when it
  happens.

## Layer boundaries (quick)

| Put in the `.mk` | Keep on the host / surface |
| --- | --- |
| Gates, tiers, `tool:` / `hook:` *names* | Tool/hook *implementations*, API keys |
| `parse: list`, compress *states* | `on_truncate` default, search backend |
| Declared `context.today: ""` / `now: ""` | Filling `today` (date) / `now` (local datetime) |
| Scenario tests next to the machine | Console consent, MCP sessions, bash/FS plugins |
| Trace / live events / ops logs mixed | Keep channels separate ([Best practices §12](best-practices.md)) |
| Generic read/write disk in core | Class-3 host tools with root + stub only ([§13](best-practices.md)) |

See [Best practices §1 and §13](best-practices.md) for the full layer map and what
may become language 0.4 later (not current syntax).
